# Predicting Earthquake Damage (DrivenData competition)

Link to competition: https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/57/nepal-earthquake/

My goal is to predict the extent of damage in an area after an earthquake. To do so, 
I used geographic features and a variety of models to classify the extent of damage. 

After my analysis, the model that I found to work the best was an xgboost model 
with hypertuning. There is still room for further analysis and for improvement 
of the existing model.
